# Liver Disease Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person has liver disease based on medical features such as age, gender, and blood test results.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is trained using the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)** and applies classification algorithms like:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Features Used

- Age  
- Gender  
- Total Bilirubin  
- Direct Bilirubin  
- Alkaline Phosphotase  
- Alamine Aminotransferase (ALT)  
- Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)  
- Total Proteins  
- Albumin  
- Albumin and Globulin Ratio

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
